# MatchStick
In this project I had to make a game know as Matchstick. The goal of the project is to have your opponent being the last one to remove a stick from the game board.
In order to do so, I had to create an AI capable of beating the school's testing AI and you can play the game by cloning the repository then launch the "make" command in a terminal and when that is done you can write the following command "./matchstick x y" with x being the number of lines you want there to be in your game board and y being the maximum amount of sticks you can remove in one turn. once the game is launched, you will begin by selecting which line you want to remove the sticks from and the amount of sticks you wish to remove in this turn on the previously selected line.
Final grade: 93.9%
